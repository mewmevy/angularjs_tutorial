Well. Finally got around to create my own Blog. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com). I use Markdown to author my posts. Actually, I don't even know what Ruby and Markdown is. However many tutorial availiable around. So, It is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
